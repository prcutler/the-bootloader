# Welcome

Welcome and thanks for listening to The Bootloader.  We're starting a new rhythm with the newsletter
and it will arrive in your inbox about two weeks after the episode which means it's only two weeks
until the next episode.  (And maybe even a sneak peek of the next episode just for newsletter subscribers.)

## Show Highlights

We were thrilled to welcome Liz Clark as our first guest to the show.  Liz shared the new iOS app from
Adafruit, itsaSNAP.  It supports Apple Shortcuts and acts as a bridge between Adafruit IO and and your iOS device.
Liz also shared the Nothing to See / Hear wireless guitar fuzz pedal.  We also chatted about the new Raspberry Pi
AI Camera, Guy Dupont's Bumpin' Sticker, Steph Piper's maker skill trees, and a new open source firmware for Bambu
Lab X1 Carbon 3D printers.

A few things we found interesting that didn't make it into the show:

* [Supercon](https://hackaday.io/superconference/) starts November 1st and Tod will be there.  They recently released the list of [speakers for day one](https://hackaday.com/2024/09/17/2024-hackaday-superconference-speakers-round-one/).
On a previous episode we had shared some concerns about the lack of diversity in Supercon's lineup and it's
good to see a more diverse lineup this year for day one.
* Speaking of Hackday, I missed this back in August, but they [shared an article about Stemfie](https://hackaday.com/2024/08/13/stemfie-the-3d-printable-construction-set/), the 3D printable
construction set.  Hackaday describes it as "a mixture between LEGO Technic and Meccano".
* [Sandify](https://sandify.org/) is a web site that helps you create generative geometric patterns for sand art / plotters. That is, it creates vectors connected logically for moves by physical devices. It's [open source](https://github.com/jeffeb3/sandify) and is really fun to play with even if you don't have one of those output devices.
* [Pislide](https://github.com/JarvyJ/pislide-os) is a set-n-forget custom Raspberry Pi firmware for displaying photo slideshows. Just burn the SD card, boot it once, then load up the SD card with photos from your computer, and reboot. It's one of the simplest "single function" Raspberry Pi builds I've seen and a great use for an old Pi sitting in a drawer.
* One of my (Tod's) favorite Eurorack synth builders, Tom Whitwell (aka Music Thing Modular), has announced his [Workshop System](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/workshopsystem/). It's a small complete modular synth in a tiny case you build yourself (and easy to build). It's got an RP2040-based "Computer" module that can be cleverly reprogrammed with a collection of "cards". I've had some involvement in the Computer aspect I'll be able to share later. It's really cool and I can't wait for it to be released!

## From the hosts

### Paul

**What I'm working on:** After talking about the [PiCade in episode 12](https://www.thebootloader.net/blog/2024/09/02/from-arcade-to-synth/#816-pimoronis-picade-max-arcade-paul-1),
I was inspired to pick up my stand up  arcade after a two year break.  I've cut and sanded all the wood, run the router to add t-molding, and started drilling holes for the control panel.  I've never done any kind of
woodworking, so this has been quite the learning experience. I also made the decision to switch
from a Pi to a PC.  Part of that decision was related to RetroPie, the retro gaming OS for Raspberry Pi, hasn't
had a new release in over two years.  I've switched  to [Batocera Linux](https://batocera.org), which has an active
community and is available on almost all platforms, including PC, Raspberry Pi, and more. Maybe in a couple more
years I'll get it done!

I also updated [The Bootloader's website](https://www.thebootloader.net).  It now has an auto / light / dark mode
selection and also has search.

**What I'm watching:** Shogun and The Old Man on FX.  I'm halfway through Shogun and I can see why it won so many
Emmy awards recently - I'm really enjoying it.  The Old Man stars Jeff Bridges as a retired CIA operative living
in hiding and John Lithgow is the FBI director tasked with finding him.  They have a shared history and the show
features flashbacks to their past.  It's great to see Jeff Bridges - the old man - as an action star.

### Tod

**What I'm working on:**
Several folks have asked for a MIDI In/Out version of my [MacroPadSynthPlug](https://github.com/todbot/macropadsynthplug) gadget and if it could be used for other
boards with StemmaQT/Qwiic connectors.  The answer has always been [sometimes](https://github.com/todbot/macropadsynthplug#does-this-work-for-other-boards-with-stemmaqt), which isn't a very satisfyin answer.
So I'm working on an updated version that provides three functions: MIDI In, MIDI Out, and PWM audio out and a way to assign any of those functions to the SCL or SDA pins of the StemmaQT port. Hopefully will have some prototypes in a few weeks.

**What I'm watching:**
Recently started watching Resident Alien with Alan Tudyk, and it's pretty good. It's set in a small town in Colorado but it's clearly filmed in a small town in British Columbia, and I'm a sucker for Canadian TV productions (snow! trees! things we don't get in SoCal)



## Coming up on the next episode
A sneak peek at the next episode: We welcome our second guest in a row to the show.
I won't spoil the surprise, but they currently have a campaign on Crowd Supply for a new product.
