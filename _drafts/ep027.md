### Covert Regional Communication with Meshtastic (Paul #1)
If you've ever wanted to learn more about [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) and how it works, this is the talk for you.
Daryll Strauss gave a talk titled [Covert Regional Communication with Meshtastic](https://www.youtube.com/live/2_xXU-u4QTQ?si=NUwnZBTXSOZK1ori), which was the last talk of the day at Supercon.

Daryll covers what Meshtastic is, his motivations for using it, and how to make a covert communication system using Meshtastic. His goal in making it covert was to support his local communities during these troubling times, as well as:
* No eavesdropping
* Limited geographic area
* Difficult to locate transmissions
* Psuedononymous

### Microsoft open sources the Zork 1 - 3 games (Paul #2)

In October 2023, Microsoft spent a cool $75 billion to purchase Activision Blizzard. Now two years later, we get a bonus from Microsoft, as they announced on November 20th that they have open sourced the Zork 1 - 3 games, which they acquired from Activision Blizzard, who owned the Infocom IP.

If you're not familiar with Zork, it was a text adventure game first released in 1977 to run on a mainframe and was developed at MIT.  The player explolrers the ruins of the Great Underground Empire and you use text commands to travel to different locations, solve puzzles and collect treasure.

### Doctype the HTML Magazine (Paul #3)

[Doctype](https://vole.wtf/doctype/) is a magazine that you can purchase for $10.  It includes ten web apps that you 
code right from the pages of the magazine, like we did back in the 80s when we were kids.

Their frequently asked questions on the home page sum it up nicely:

***I don’t understand, it’s a magazine of HTML source code?***
Yes, you type it in then you get to play the games and run the apps.

***Type it all in? Why?!***
Because it’s a lost form of software distribution. It was intriguing and rewarding back then, maybe it still is now.

With the holidays here, it might make an interesting gift for someone younger just getting into computers - learn the same way we did way back when.
