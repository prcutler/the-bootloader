### Naya Connect Modular Keyboard Kickstarter (Paul #1)

The Naya Connect is the second product launch from Naya, who has a Kickstarter campaign for their new modular keyboard, the Naya Connect. They previously launched their split keyboard also on Kickstarter.

The Naya Connect features a low profile keyboard that's ultra thin at just under 15mm. But what's innovative about it is that it's modular, allowing users to customize their keyboard layout and functionality. You can choose from different expansion modules including:

* Multipad - a 4x4 Macropad that can work as a number pad or anything you program it for.
* An extra column of 6 keys, laid out vertically.
* 4 different input modules to let you replace your mouse, including a trackball, touchpad, a dial and a floating joystick.

And what's really neat about all of these modules is they're made for both right and left-handed users with connections for reach module on either side.

It also includes Naya Flow, their custom software that allows you to program your keyboard layout and all of the modules.

If you're quick, you can jump on the Kickstarter as it has about a week left from when this episode is being released. Options start at about $180 and quickly go up from there depending on what modules you choose.
