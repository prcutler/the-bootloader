### Naya Connect Modular Keyboard Kickstarter (Paul #1)

The Naya Connect is the second product launch from Naya, who has a Kickstarter campaign for their new modular keyboard, the Naya Connect. They previously launched their split keyboard also on Kickstarter.

The Naya Connect features a low profile keyboard that's ultra thin at just under 15mm. But what's innovative about it is that it's modular, allowing users to customize their keyboard layout and functionality. You can choose from different expansion modules including:

* Multipad - a 4x4 Macropad that can work as a number pad or anything you program it for.
* An extra column of 6 keys, laid out vertically.
* 4 different input modules to let you replace your mouse, including a trackball, touchpad, a dial and a floating joystick.

And what's really neat about all of these modules is they're made for both right and left-handed users with connections for reach module on either side.

It also includes Naya Flow, their custom software that allows you to program your keyboard layout and all of the modules.

If you're quick, you can jump on the Kickstarter as it has about a week left from when this episode is being released. Options start at about $180 and quickly go up from there depending on what modules you choose.

### Let's chat about the Adafruit Fruit Jam (Paul #2)

The Adafruit Fruit Jam was first released at the end of July in 2025 and went out to thousands of Adabox subscribers last November.  If you haven't heard of the Fruit Jam, it's Adafruit's take on building a mini-computer using the rp2350b microcontroller. With all the extra GPIO in the rp2350b, Adafruit was able to add DVI out using an HDMI port, 2 USB ports for USB host to hook up gamepads, mice, and keyboards, a microSD card slot, and a StemmaQT port to add additional sensors.

Not only is the product innovative, I'm blown away by the community's reponse and all the cool software that is available to run on the Fruit Jam.

  * Fruit Jam OS includes a number of apps and games, including Breakout, an IRC client, Minesweeper, PyPaint, and more.

### Washington State's proposed 3D printing bills (Paul #3)

Washington State representative Osman Salahuddin has proposed two bills:

HB 2320 adds criminal liability around digital firearm manufacturing code and classifies the machines that make these parts as part of firearms law.

HB2321 requires any 3D printer sold or transferred in Washington after July 1st 2027 to include mandatory DRM that has blocking features that can detect a firearms blueprint. As Adafruit shared:  “ Printers would have to examine every file, compare it against a centrally maintained list of prohibited designs, reject flagged jobs, and be engineered to resist bypass by “users with significant technical skill.””

The language as it is proposed is too broad, and I’ll leave you with this quote from the Adafruit blog post:

“ None of these controls stop “determined actors”. What they do is burden lawful users, destroy open-source innovation, and force proprietary stacks and cloud services, not safety.”
