## Show Notes

### Building my own Steam Machine (Paul #1)

Back in mid-November, [Valve announcesd the Steam Machine](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/), their first console-like PC that 
runs SteamOS, a derivative of Arch Linux. But there's also [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), a immutable OS based on Fedora that turns your PC, handheld, home theater PC into a full game console.

### CAD Round-up (Paul #2)

A round-up of recent CAD news, starting with Hackaday's recent story on BREP.io. BREP stands for brand new, from-scratch boundary representation. BREP.io is a new browser based CAD where all computation is done on the client side, including complex operations like fillets, lofts and more. Check out the story at Hackday, follow the project page, or check out the GitHub repository.

* [BREP.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/204166-brepio-a-browser-based-parametric-modeler)

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmiscool/BREP)

Next up is Microcad, which is very young in its development and is still in alpha. Their home page calls it a new open source programming language that can generate 2D sketches and 3D objects. The easiest comparison is probably something like OpenSCAD. They've got some neat videos of how they're using Microcad to create models, including a logo, LEGO bricks, gears, and more.

Lastly is CADQuest, a website to help you level up your CAD skills. It has a free and paid tier, but I haven't tried it out personally.  They claim it works with any CAD software, but it looks like they prefer SolidWorks. So if you're into gamification to level up your CAD skills, it might be worth checking out.
