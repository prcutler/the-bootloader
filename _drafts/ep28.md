## Show Notes

### Building my own Steam Machine (Paul #1)

Back in mid-November, [Valve announcesd the Steam Machine](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/), their first console-like PC that 
runs SteamOS, a derivative of Arch Linux. But there's also [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), a immutable OS based on Fedora that turns your PC, handheld, home theater PC into a full game console.

### CAD Round-up (Paul #2)

A round-up of recent CAD news, starting with Hackaday's recent story on BREP.io. BREP stands for brand new, from-scratch boundary representation. BREP.io is a new browser based CAD where all computation is done on the client side, including complex operations like fillets, lofts and more. Check out the story at Hackday, follow the project page, or check out the GitHub repository.

* [BREP.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/204166-brepio-a-browser-based-parametric-modeler)

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmiscool/BREP)

Next up is Microcad, which is very young in its development and is still in alpha. Their home page calls it a new open source programming language that can generate 2D sketches and 3D objects. The easiest comparison is probably something like OpenSCAD. They've got some neat videos of how they're using Microcad to create models, including a logo, LEGO bricks, gears, and more.

Lastly is CADQuest, a website to help you level up your CAD skills. It has a free and paid tier, but I haven't tried it out personally.  They claim it works with any CAD software, but it looks like they prefer SolidWorks. So if you're into gamification to level up your CAD skills, it might be worth checking out.

### The Indie Beat FM and Television (Paul #3)

Way back in [episode 9, we talked about Radio Free Fedi](https://www.thebootloader.net/episodes/ep009/#429-radiofreefedi-and-faircamp-paul-1), the streaming radio station made up of artists on the Fediverse, like Mastodon. Just over a year ago, Radio Free Fedi shut down on January 1st, 2025. 

The spirit of RadioFreeFedi lives on in the Indie Beat Radio stations and now Indie Beat Television. The Indie Beat Radio federates with Bandwagon.fm and features over 4000 songs streaming. The Indie Beat Television just launched on December 28th and features videos from Fediverse artists.
