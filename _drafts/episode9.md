### PlumPot KiCad Tutorials (Tod #2)

I have finally made the jump from Eagle to KiCad.  After 20 years of Eagle. 
A video series that really helped me was [PlumPot's video playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b). 

* [PlumPot KiCad Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b)
* PlumPot is Keri PLUMstead and JP POTgieter
* Goes from installing KiCad, to creating symbols & footprints to to ordering PCBs with gerber files
* An older series (KiCad 5), but still really helpful
* Because goes into some of the tricky details that haven't changed much, 
    like [adding 3d files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrOBbDDqE9w&list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b&index=5), [clearance & track rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF6PF0L4e-s&list=PLZNH6jlLeFXsg9ohRMbJ0qqSfUrRyAn7b&index=23), blind vias, differential pairs, and more

### Algorithm videos by Freya Holmér  (Tod #3)

Freya is a game dev who codes tools and shaders for Unity but also creates
these highly instructive and very beautiful videos about algorithms that are 
useful in game design but also in generative art and embedded computers. 

* ["Lerp smoothing in broken"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSNQuFEDOyQ) 
  -- Lerp ("linear interpolation") is used to smooth movement of an on-screen element
     It's similar to a common sensor filtering technique called ["exponential smoothing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing) and both suffer from similar issues when the
     "frame rate" or "sample rate" change. 
  
* ["The Beauty of Bézier Curves"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw)
  -- Bezier curves always kinda mystified me, this video shows how they work.

* ["Why can't you multiply vectors?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htYh-Tq7ZBI)
  -- In the microcontroller space, if you use attitude sensors (gyros/accelerometers) or 
  are making a little game (like my [circuitpython-staroids](https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython_staroids), you'll need to know how to manipulate vectors. This video breaks down how vectors work, 
  shows how to modify and combine them to get what you want.
