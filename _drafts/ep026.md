## Show Notes

### Liz's Pick #1: Raspberry Pi Connect
https://connect.raspberrypi.com/

Raspberry Pi Connect is a service that comes with the new distributions of Raspberry Pi OS. I've been doing a lot of development with Raspberry Pi's recently and I've found it to be really helpful. It lets you access a terminal or screen share session to your Raspberry Pi through your browser and then you can use your desktop mouse, keyboard and monitor to interact with it. The best feature though in my opinion is that you can copy and paste to and from the Pi with it.

### Liz's Pick #2: MIDI Baby Gen4

Disaster Area Designs makes a lot of music utility pedals aimed at guitarists. Its operated by Matthew Farrow, who also runs Alexander Pedals. They have a new release for their MIDI Baby pedal, which is a teeny tiny single foot switch that lets you send MIDI messages over TRS, DIN-5 or USB. The Gen4 though has an exciting new feature: it has an RP2040 inside and Matthew has ported it to CircuitPython. He has demo code for it up on GitHub and I'm hoping to do some fun experiments with it.
