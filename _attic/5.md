Welcome to The Bootloader!

* [Micropython by Arduino Labs](https://blog.arduino.cc/2022/11/10/micropython-officially-becomes-part-of-the-arduino-ecosystem/)
  * It works well! Simple and clean, with what you need: code editor + terminal window
  * Works with any MicroPython device with USB serial, from my limited testing
  * No serial plotter, no library manager, no board manager. This is a first step
  * However, it is yet-another-[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app, so it's fairly pudgy memory-wise
  * Alternatives:
    * [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) -- beloved by many. I do not like it, find it unattractive and confusing
    * [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) -- cleaner and has a nice serial plotter like Arduino IDE
    * Any text editor + [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) -- my preferred choice
    * What I do not recommend: any "micropython extension" for VS Code/Atom/etc.
      The ones I've tried are flaky and presume too much, taking over other Python projects

* [WithDiode.com](https://www.withdiode.com/explore) -- 3d breadboard simulation in the browser
  * omg. this is the best. so fun
  * Created by [Kennth Cassel](https://twitter.com/KennethCassel)
    * (who also created a nice [Vim tutorial site called vim.so](https://www.vim.so/)
  * I saw it first from [Clive Thompson (@clive@saturation.social) on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@clive@saturation.social/109344907748519044)
  * I was able to implement some of the oscillators we did during
    [Deep Fried Neurons](https://blog.crashspace.org/tag/deep-fried-neurons/)
    * [DeepFriedNeurons breadboard oscillators](https://blog.crashspace.org/2021/05/dfn-happy-hour-no-43-good-vibrations/)
  * But... it's actually kinda harder to use than real breadboards
  * Other tools I find useful in this space:
    * [Wokwi simulator](https://wokwi.com/) lets you simulate Arduino, Micropython, and CircuitPython
    * [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) lets you visually breadboard up circuits,
      with accompanying breadboard & PCB layout

* [RNBO "rainbow"](https://cycling74.com/products/rnbo) -- Turn Max patches into VST plugins
  * Ever wonder how people make virtual synths / audio effects, or even real synths & effects?
  * [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) is a way to create custom virtual instruments or effects, and custom UI. Make it look like a real thing if you want
  * Max is often a good solution to mocking up ideas for these, kinda like CircuitPython and Arduino is for microcontroller projects
    * Max is a stand-alone application or part of Ableton Live
    * It's what's called a "patching environment", a "nodes & flows" graphical programming tool
    * The "flows" are audio & MIDI, kinda like modular synths cabling stuff together
    * I've used in on-n-off (mostly off) since the 90s (could never quite get into it)
    * But Max patches have to live inside Max (or inside Max in Live)
  * RNBO let's you create a "compilable" versions of Max patch
    * It is inclucded with Max or $299 for permanent license or $10/month subscription
    * RNBO is actually a parallel thing to Max, but implements most all of Max
    * But does Turns any Max patch into a C++-based stand-alone VST
    * Can even target Raspberry Pi, so you can make custom Pi-based synths & pedals
    * Or can export to Web Audio, with Javascript control!
  * [good CDM article about RNBO](https://cdm.link/2022/11/rnbo-max-for-web-hardware-plugin/)
  * [good synthanatomy article too](https://www.synthanatomy.com/2022/11/rnbo-turns-your-max-patches-into-hardware-vst-plugins-and-web-applications.html) about why this is cool
  * [Online (paid) class for how to use it by Music Hackspace](https://musichackspace.org/product/getting-started-with-rnbo-in-max/) Here's a [preview on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XK6crVcXefk)
  * Open source alternative to Max is [PureData (aka 'Pd')](https://puredata.info/)
    * Pd & Max have common roots, Pd is a bit rougher looking than Max, but very capable
    * And it runs on a Raspberry Pi
    * And there's a [huge community](https://patchstorage.com/explore) of existing Pd patches.
    * And there's the [free online Heavy compiler](https://www.rebeltech.org/2018/09/12/compile-pure-data-patches-with-free-online-heavy-compiler/) for Pd patches

* Home Assistant and the [State of the Open Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D936T1Ze8-4) - Nov 13, 2022
  * Home automation platform focused on local control and privacy
    * No vendor log-in
    * Your smart home shouldn't require the cloud
  * State of the Open Home is an annual look at the smart home ecosystem and Home Assistant
    * #2 open source project on Github by contributor contributions
    * Home Assistant Cloud from Nabu Casa processed 50,000 webhooks per second
    * 190,000 instances of HA opted in to reporting
      * Estimated 500,000 - 600,000 installations of HA
    * 2023: Year of Voice
      * Rhasspy voice assistant: https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy by Michael Hansen
        * Can function completely disconnected from the Internet
        * Are entirely free/open source with a permissive license (MIT)
        * Works well with freely available home automation software
        * Optimized for working with MQTT, HTTP and Websockets with Home Assistant having built in support
        * Support for over 25 different languages
      * Hired by Nabu Casa to work on and integrate Rhasspy full-time
      * [Summary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krQjw-j7rXI)

* GitHub in the news
  * Follow-up: the investigation has spawned a [GitHub Copilot lawsuit](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/11/githubs_copilot_opinion/)
  * [Hey Github](https://githubnext.com/projects/hey-github)
    * Imagine being able to code hands free
    * This could be big for accessibility
    * Use natural speech, for example: Saying "Import pandas" results in `import pandas as pd`
    * In the features, Github shares:
      * Write / edit code (using GitHub Copilot)
      * Go to the next method with code navigation ("Hey GitHub go to line 34 or method X)
      * Run the program and control your IDE using any VS Code command
      * Code Summarization: Ask "Hey GitHub!" to explain lines 3-10 and get a summary of what the code does
